Razorpay Payment Gateway Project Description
Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration is a Node.js and React-based project that allows businesses to accept online payments through Razorpay, a popular payment gateway. This application integrates the Razorpay API for seamless payment processing, providing users with a secure way to make transactions.

With this integration, users can make payments for goods or services through the front-end React application. On the back-end, the Node.js server handles the communication with the Razorpay API, manages transactions, and performs necessary actions such as payment verification and invoice generation.

The system supports the following features:

Payment Gateway Integration: Secure and easy payment collection through Razorpay.

Backend Server (Node.js): A robust server built with Express.js to handle payment requests, including creation and verification of payments.

Environment Variables: Using dotenv for secure management of sensitive API keys.

Scheduled Tasks: Uses node-cron to handle recurring tasks such as sending payment reminders or processing recurring payments.

Email Notifications: Implements Nodemailer to send confirmation emails to users after successful transactions.

Database Integration: PostgreSQL (pg) is used to store payment details and transaction history securely.
